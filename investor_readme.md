## üåç The Problem We're Solving

### Critical Healthcare Challenge
**Breast cancer is the #1 cancer killer of women aged 20-59**, yet survival rates vary dramatically based on detection timing:
- **Stage 0-1 Detection (Localized)**: **99-100% five-year survival rate**
- **Stage 4 Detection (Distant)**: **27% five-year survival rate**
- **Global Impact**: 685,000 deaths annually could be prevented with earlier detection
- **2025 Projections**: ~310,720 new invasive breast cancer cases and ~42,170 deaths expected in the US

### Market Gaps
